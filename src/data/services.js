      'Realtime is the act of connecting directly to a court reporter during a deposition or in court to see the transcript of the testimony as it is being recorded "in real time." Think of it as live closed captioning with which you can interact. Realtime viewed on an iPad using iCVNet can be highlighted and searched. However, at the end of your deposition, it can be imported to CaseView Net on your PC where you can also mark issues as well as run reports.',
